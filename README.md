# VBA-challenge
---
**For this assignment, we are instructed to complete the following tasks:**
---
- Creating a script looping through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
*The ticker symbol
- Quarterly changing from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- Adding functionality to our script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
- Making appropriate adjustments to our VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
- Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
