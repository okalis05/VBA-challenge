*The ticker symbol
*Quarterly changing from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
*The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
*The total stock volume of the stock.

- Adding functionality to our script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
- Making appropriate adjustments to our VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
- Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
